# Coding Quiz App Assignment

The purpose of this app was to create a coding quiz which could be used to test your knowledge of JavaScript. It is a 75 second timed test in which time is deducted for missed answers. The hightest score at the end of the test is the winner. 

In order to create this project I was required to start from scratch and create all CSS, HTML, and JavaScript files.
